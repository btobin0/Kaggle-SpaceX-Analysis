Kaggle SpaceX Launch Data Analysis 
-------------------------------------------------

### Disclaimer

This analysis was created for fun using data that was publically available on Kaggle. 
The data was two years old and I am using it to continue my Data Science journey using the R Programming language. 

Data can be found here:
